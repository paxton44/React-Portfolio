  <h2>About Me</h2>


  <p>Hello, my name is Mitch Flood and I am a 26 year old residing in Denver, CO. I started my professional life as an
  electrician where I was consistently trouble shooting to find
  solutions to the problem at hand. I loved the technical creativity of being an electrician but decided it was time
  to look for a less life threatening career. As I looked
  for a career change, I knew I wanted to continue to utilize my problem solving skills in my next role. This led me
  to coding. I'm currently a student at Denver University where I am
  becoming a full stack web developer. I love the never ending challenge that is coding and look forward to
  developing my skills even further. In my free time, I enjoy creating music with
  digital audio workstations and spending time with my wife and two cats.
